# StudentDatabase
 Project Unfinished still in progress
Backend functionality seems to be working all right features allow for a Student to Enter there ID and name and DOB and then submits to a MySql Database using jdbc Driver.
Once there is data in the database it can be deleted, updated, submitted and all data in the database is able to be shown with the show all button 

Things I plan on improving on this project:
Frontend side of the project 
Implementing a better search functionality for smoother experience
Add a way to display the data that is found on the JavaFX GUI instead of the database alone,
Fixing DOB 

Ultimate end goal:
Make it more of an attractive experience for users to interact with
